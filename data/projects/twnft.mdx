I was new to web3 when I made TwNFT but then there was [Thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) so that I did not have to break my head writing Solidity and then not burn my computer down when I would mess up. I wanted to make something related to web3 and this was one of the ideas that I had at that time (and it was the best one). I built TwNFT as a part of the [Thirdweb x Hashnode Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/thirdweb-hackathon) (and it turned out to be one of the winners :) ). As of now, there are 81 TwNFTs minted by 73 people (including me). You can see the [TwNFT Collection here](https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/twnft).

For more details on TwNFT and how to use it, read my [blog post introducing TwNFT](https://blog.anishde.dev/twnft-mint-your-tweets-as-nfts-easily-and-for-free)
