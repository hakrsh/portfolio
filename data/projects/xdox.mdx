It was March and my exams were over (and so I had also started 100 days of code) but I faced a big problem, that is, **there was no "proper" way to log the 100 days of code progresses**. I started out by logging it on a GitHub repository but found it cumbersome. Of course I had been [tweeting my progress](https://twitter.com/search?f=top&q=(%23100DaysOfCode)%20(from%3AAnishDe12020)&src=typed_query) as well but eh...

Also the [Hasura x Hashnode Hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/hasura-hackathon) had started so I found this as the perfect idea for a hackathon project.

Now, I regularly add my 100 days of code progress to XdoX, check it out [on my profile page](https://www.xdox.me/@anishde12020/8c06dd6e-b34f-4451-aef2-bc20d164bbff/75)
