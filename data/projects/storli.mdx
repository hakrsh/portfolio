[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is an amazing technology that lets one store files in decentralized nodes. I wanted to build a CLI and in my usual hobby of researching random things, I came across [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) (great website btw). They had gotten an amazing JS SDK and as an oppurtunity to work with IPFS, web3.storage and [oclif](https://oclif.io/), I build Storli and [launched it on ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/storli).

You can see how to use Storli [in the project's README](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/storli#readme)
