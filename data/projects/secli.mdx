I just wanted to build something simple with Rust and this idea just popped into my mind. I explored some other CLIs written in Rust, understood the working and then decided to make Secli as a part of learning. Few days into building, I realised that this can potentially have a large user base so I decided to make a logo and banner and also [launch it on Producthunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/secli) :)

You can see how to use Secli [in the project's README](https://github.com/AnishDe12020/secli#readme)
